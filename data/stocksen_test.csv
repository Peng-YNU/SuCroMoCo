so based on $uber $lyft which i did say take almost every ipo and short it. they all came in with massive debt. read up on venture capital and private equity. investors want to get their money back. notice the uber ipo at the open. they got so desperate trying to get the right price that the ceo gave the green light on anything and dumped it. he didn t care. it is probably not even trading at the right price. but really $tsla should be trading at this altitude. this stock is history. you have to be a moron. if it was trading with the other automotive industry i would give them maybe a chance... but they would have to get rid of their debt. look at their bonds. a massive payment is up in november and how is elon musk going to pay it.	0

$tsla i am almost positive that tesla will go bankrupt. i just called fidelity because i have never been through such a short. so here is the deal and consult with your bank $spy they will not notify you . you need to keep a close eye on the stock before the company declares bankruptcy. they declare bankruptcy your shares may be locked. i was told by fidelity that enron shorts still have some of their shares locked and they can t release them until they go through litigation. enron. so as soon as i see this stock going down in flames i am going to cover way way before they announce bankruptcy. there is no way i want my cash locked. $study pay attention and ask questions to your bank.	0

$baba safest ship on stock market 💸 💸 💸 💸 💸	1
$baba glad i didn t bail on this after er. up over 100%	1
$baba broke out of the lower half of the bollinger bands. could potentially make a run to the mid 180s in the next week with the breakout.	1
$baba this is what happens the first day that altaba is done selling. i think the updated share count will show those clowns are finally done selling 25% of the total weekly volume of this name. it was pretty much the same as a reverse buyback holding down the prices artificially while the company crushed numbers and no one could understand why $bzun and $jd were outperforming while having vastly inferior companies. baba might be the cheapest stock peg wise in the world. this stock is going so much higher 🚀 🚀	1
$sftby $baba $s once people realize softbank has a huge stake in alibaba and sprint this will see some movement.	1

$jd $baba watch your little internet brother who also smashed earnings and is about to make a break out $sogo	1
$baba trade deal should be coming soon. trump knows his time is up and he will be forced to make one. his re-election depends on it. china isn t going to give in and has been playing hard ball. renegotiate where it works for both not just one side. hoping for positive trade news next week.	1
$baba macd crossed up	1

$baba down down left right left right ab ab select start	1
