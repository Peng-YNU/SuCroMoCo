$amzn re-post-- again- if you missed this dwyer is 10000% correct the fed should not of raised in december and with inflation still running well below their mandate; in the face of tariffs that are inflationary have been in place yet inflation is still below target why didn t powell cut bizarre in fact the best question at that news conference- if you re projecting a rate cut in future won t many investors hold off for lower ratesüßêüßê. so by the feds very approach they just might be creating further slowdown if i were trump- i d be bullshit this fight with the world to make better deals for us- the american people- could of been made easier with a normal thinking fed so who benefits is trump wins all these trade battles even a dumb democrat should know thst answer wanting to see trump fail is analogous to wanting to see your home country fail where s the lie	1

$bynd some people want to short it now. because it s overvalued obviously but my case and point is $tlry this is simple basic supply and demand. - the stock has a 9.6 mm float. - 50% short interest over 80% costs - they got a good pr team. - multiple outlets. - $mcd ceo on the board of bynd - sold in retailer across the world like wholefoods aka $amzn - huge spike in brand recognition. - so why short it now unless it s a scalp take the short when the lock up expires and just go on a vacation until the dilution the selling should have stopped. i rather take the easy trade. fd: i m still long from 66s use common sense and a sl obviously i wouldn t recommend holding a overnight short and its squeezed so many shorts out. some furu s were screaming short at 60s and took a nasty loss.	1

$amzn healthy consolidation for the next leg up. now worries here imo as long as bulls defend $1891. weekly chart.	1
$amzn i mentioned the 1995 scenario before tony dwyer started to speak of it and present it on cnbc. i also mentioned during and just prior to the correction in may that we could get 5-10% correction around may 3-14 based off the seasonal road map studies we did...in that same token i believed that the 1995 correction that came later on this chart was what we had in may. 1995 has many similarities to what we re seeing today especially with interest rates	1
$amzn $dis here s another view of the disney longterm base breakout with a measured move to $150-160	1
$amzn $dis ... continued sorry the image didn t attach to last post regarding medium to longer term view of dis going to $150	1
$amzn $dis i see disney going to 150 medium to longer term... that view was conceived at $108	1
$amzn one thing i know for sure is i m not a theoretical physicist. another thing i know for sure is they are smarter than me. so after i do all my research and hypothesis and write it down and share with u guys- i compare my studies to someone smarter than me- sounds reasonable here s what a theoretical physicist thinks about the upcoming market moves url	1
$amzn ... continued from the previous post regarding mike santoli presentation.. here s one i presented from a while ago the concept is the same. it s a long consolidation concept. in this chart is looking even farther out on yearly concept. but u will see the idea	1
$amzn $nflx here s a better view of that fibonacci study on nflx to 374	1
$amzn $nflx nflx had the 374 fib extension posted on this chart a few presentations ago exactly what we hit today	1
$amzn ... continued and here s what happened after it did that work we just discussed in the last two posts	1
$amzn ... continued so here s a look at the last time amazon broke above the daily cloud and consolidated above it it did that work to get above and then started with a little consolidation candle similar to what we saw in the current instance in the previous chart	1

"$amzn $spy some proprietary oscillators i use around high yield bonds-- have kicked up above a mean line that the last two times it did it was in the beginning of 2016 after the correction and then just recently in december 2018 correction and then just now in may. the prior two times resulted in strong ""initiation"" of uptrends. not the end of them."	1
$btc.x $bch.x $amzn $fb	1
$fb $amzn $ba the fut looks red.. buy the fcking dip early in the morning way to be rich.. very rich	1
$amzn goodnight everyone	1
$amzn when every single democrat running in 2020 has a platform of: increase corporate tax cuts- which will obviously cut profits shrink valuations- translation- lower stock prices-- lower 401k lower net wealth when every democrat wants to increase capital gains tax- tax trades- tax basically how all of us earn- what will happen to the market yet everyday i see fools saying market will be ok if dems win i can only can conclude that you are beyond stupid- or you are simply lonely trolls who do not trade dems will tax your friggin oxygen this will effect short traders- longs- the entire market not one dem has solutions it s just tax attack those of us who achieved success because aren t successful people- the ones who actually pay taxes- aren t we the problem success should be emulated not derided i expect everyone the dems want to give free checks to will vote for them but do we want a weak country of freeloaders	1

$sbux news is totally overblown. a manager should have handled the situation not a barista. starbucks is a great company and the situation will be fixed. people somwhow forget starbucks got sh for calling police over a noncustomer for loitering and using the bathroom and they tried to paint starbucks as racist. now they want to paint them as anticop. so called conservstives are turning out to be as whiny as liberals. btw up 85% in a year because customers care about good coffee not stupid incidents like these that happen in every fast food chain every year almost daily that you never hear about.	1

$tsla i hate the term squeeze because i don t wish upon anyone that they lose their hard earned money and i find the dialectic of pro and con very intellectually barren. but what is happening is that there are 40 million people betting this stock will go down which is like 30% of total stock ownership. if the stock skyrockets they will be out a lot of money. so we are approaching a tipping point soon where those folks will buy driving up the price. i didn t even understand short selling and couldn t believe it s legal. i had to watch multiple youtube videos to even understand how it works. fundamentally the idea of making fortunes on another s loss is not for me. but i concord that there is going to be a short squeeze for the ages when it happens because when the story of the company the story of the stock become double arrows in opposite directions that s what hapoens. the arc of the stock will bend towards the reality of the company. but again i don t wish anyone any $ harm.	1

$admp will $myl deal with $pfe start reversal in biotech comparing mylan s and adamis s charts the past 6 months have similar patterns and both down aprox 40%. monday could be interesting. dennis company did a good job with fast lawsuit settlement. now close partnership deal with up front cash for naloxone and fda approval before pdufa october 31 and stock will be at more appropriate level. investors could start to have some confidence in the company. next q report update should be positive. investors deserve better and dennis wants to leave a legacy of being successful.	1
